# Web App From Scratch
Course from the minor Web Development 1617 at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. During this week of the course I'll learn to use API's. For this assignment I'll make use of the random user generator.
 
 
#Assignment

For this assignment i created an app for showing 5 random users. You can see their profile picture and profile information. The code is not really clean but it kinda works. Because i did not really understand Routie i wasnt able to retrieve the information of the clicked person so i loaded a new user with the username beloning to the person clicked.

Since the api is random i wasnt able to retrieve the person.

I will to get a better understanding of Javascript and How i should write the code in the vacation.
