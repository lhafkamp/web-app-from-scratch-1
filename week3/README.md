#Week 3: Wrapping up

In the final week of this course we'll have to finish our Single Page Applictation(SPA).

I also created a flowchart and actor diagram for the script I wrote which can be seen below.

###App Features
* Select users by gender
* Select users by country
* Sort users alphabetically by username
* Show user information when clicked on the user picture

_The first three filters can be combined._
